Open Wichita is a community organization focused on exploring the ways
technology can be used to improve the quality of life for Wichitans. We know
that our city can be better. We believe that we can make it better by using data
and technology in new and creative ways.

We are open to anyone and everyone who cares about making Wichita a better place
using creative solutions. We are committed to providing a welcoming and
inclusive environment for all, read the [Code for America Code of
Conduct](https://github.com/codeforamerica/codeofconduct/blob/master/README.md)

## Why is this important?

Communities across the globe have experienced the benefits of open data and
civic technology, such as:

* Fostering [economic growth](http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-1/ashvilles-open-data-journey-pragmatics-policy-and-participation/) opportunities
* Better [decision making and resource utilization](http://beyondtransparency.org/chapters/part-4/beyond-open-data-the-data-driven-city/) through data visualization
* [Increased government efficiency](http://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/workshop/samos/) through data reuse within departments
* Increased public safety through the [utilization of crime information](http://sanfrancisco.crimespotting.org/)
* Creating [trust between government and citizens](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7393.html) through transparency
* [Citizen participation](http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2012/11/06/city-of-chicago-adopts-flu-shot-app-built-by-civic-hackers/) through tools made possible by open data
