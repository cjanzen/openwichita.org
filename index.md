# What is Open Wichita?

**Our mission is to** foster a community of civic involvement through
technology and education. We are Wichita's [Code for America
Brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/join-us/volunteer-with-us).

We are a community of individuals who want to explore the ways which technology
can be used to increase the amount and quality of civic involvement in the
Wichita area.

We believe that technology is a powerful force that can fundamentally change the
way we participate in city living. We also believe that the accessibility of
technology empowers anyone to create something that makes a major difference.
