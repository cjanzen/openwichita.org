Every moment spent outside in Wichita is a potential adventure. From extreme heat to pouring rain, from ice storms to tornados--moments matter. Especially when you're trying to get somewhere.

Now imagine you're waiting for the bus. Outside. You assume it's going to be on time, but how do you know for sure?

Open Wichita's developers are working diligently toward answering this question. "The City of Wichita's transit website already has a real time bus locator service, but we would like to enhance this feature," said lead developer Jacob Walker. "This initial project would open the door for all sorts of additional transit-related features."

We've been impressed with the City of Wichita's willingness to help with this project. In fact, several key City employees have been among the most active voices on the various Slack channels that Open Wichita members use to communicate with one another. "My position is to help the developers with ANY data needs they may have or to connect them with people in transit as needed," said Michael Mayta, Chief Information Officer for the City of Wichita. "This is a great example of public/private partnerships in doing things that matter," Mayta noted, and Walker agrees. "A well-functioning transit system is a critical lifeline for the people in our community who can't operate or afford their own transportation. I just want to help with that."
